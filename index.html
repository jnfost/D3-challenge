          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>The percentage of people in poverty in each state seems to have a correlation to many different health risks. In each
            category analyzed, higher percentages of people in poverty show higher rates in health risks. This correlation shows up
            for smoking, obesity, and lack of access to healthcare. One could also connect the lack of access to healthcare to the 
            higher levels of smoking and obesity in each state. Without guidance from medical professionals, many people do not make the
            choices that could change their smoking levels or reduce their weight.</p>

          <p>Many of the same relationships can be seen between median household income and the previously mentioned health risks.
            The lower the household income in each state, the more likely those states are to have higher levels of smoking, obesity,
            and lack of access to healthcare.
          </p>

          <p>There do not appear to be many correlations between age and health risks. All values for smoking, obesity, and lack
            of access to healthcare seem to be faily evenly distributed among different ages.</p>
